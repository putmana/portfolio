            <p>A demo of a full-stack desktop music streaming app I built as my college capstone project. The idea is to allow users to upload their own music tracks and play them back from here, providing the convenience of music streaming with the control of an MP3 player.</p>

            <p>A fully responsive weather app with a unique pixel art style designed and built entirely by me. I even made the icons. Uses the OpenWeatherMap API to find the weather near you. Built to be a fun project to put on my portfolio.</p>

            <p>A simple responsive board-based image forum website. This was originally a college project I built during my freshman year, but I've made some major modifications under the hood to make it more modular.</p>

            <p>A website to help roomates split rent and other expenses. Initially built as an extremely simple calculator to help me split my rent with my roomates, I saw an opportunity to turn this into a real project.</p>

            <p>The obligatory checklist app. You can add and remove items, change their order, and mark them as important. I built this a long time ago, but I'm still pretty happy with how the styling turned out.</p>
